.PP


.PP
\fBCross-Platform System for Advanced Cryptographic Key Management and Semantic Identity Generation\fP

.PP
.PP
.SH "1\&. Project Overview and Architecture"
.PP
Secure PassVault (SPV) is a robust, local-only password and identity management application developed in \fBC++\fP using the \fBQt Widgets Framework\fP\&. The core design adheres to the \fBModel-View-Controller (MVC)\fP architectural pattern, ensuring a clean separation between the user interface (\fR\fBMainWindow\fP\fP) and the cryptographic business logic (\fR\fBVaultBackend\fP\fP)\&.

.PP
The primary objective is to eliminate common security vulnerabilities by integrating advanced \fBSystem Programming\fP concepts directly into the data handling and persistence layers\&.
.SH "2\&. Security and Cryptographic Architecture"
.PP
The integrity and confidentiality of the database (\fRvault\&.dat\fP) rely on a multi-layered cryptographic container approach\&.
.SS "2\&.1\&. Key Derivation and Anti-Brute Force Mechanism"
The user's Master Key is transformed into a cryptographically strong encryption key using an iterative function designed to resist modern GPU-accelerated Brute Force attacks\&.

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBMechanism:\fP PBKDF2-like process (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 structure)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBKey Strength:\fP Uses a 256-bit derived key ($DK$)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBCost Parameter:\fP The process involves \fB10,000+ sequential SHA-256 iterations\fP applied to the Master Key concatenated with a unique, cryptographically random \fBSalt\fP\&. This computational delay ensures that attempted dictionary attacks are economically infeasible\&.
.PP
.SS "2\&.2\&. Data Integrity and Authentication"
The \fRvault\&.dat\fP container integrates two levels of critical verification:

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBIntegrity Control (HMAC):\fP Every save operation appends a \fBHMAC-SHA256\fP tag to the data\&. During loading, the system recalculates the HMAC using the derived key\&. Any mismatch indicates file corruption or external modification, leading to immediate access denial\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBSystem-Bound 2FA:\fP A unique \fBSystem ID Hash\fP (derived from the host machine's hardware/OS identifiers) is stored in the file header\&. Access is blocked if the file is opened on an unauthorized machine, acting as a two-factor authentication layer tied to the system itself\&.
.PP
.SS "2\&.3\&. Data Persistence Reliability"
To guarantee the stability and persistence of data across different operating environments (Dev vs\&. Release mode, different OSes), the application utilizes the \fBQStandardPaths\fP class\&.

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The system dynamically determines the absolute, writable location for application data (e\&.g\&., \fR~/Library/Application Support/SPV/\fP on macOS)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
This approach is essential to avoid failures associated with using unreliable relative paths, which are often blocked by OS security permissions in deployment environments\&.
.PP
.SH "3\&. Advanced Generation Models"
.PP
SPV implements two distinct, specialized models for creating credentials:
.SS "3\&.1\&. Cryptographic Generation (Passwords)"
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBEntropy Source:\fP Uses a \fBCryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG)\fP (\fRQRandomGenerator::system()\fP)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBStrength Analysis:\fP The generated output is analyzed in real-time using the \fBShannon Entropy Formula\fP ($E$) to provide an objective score (0–100) of password resistance: $$E = L \\times \\log_2(R)$$ Where $L$ is the length and $R$ is the size of the available character pool\&.
.PP
.SS "3\&.2\&. Semantic Generation (Nicknames/Logins)"
This module generates unique identifiers that are both memorable and complex:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBData Volume:\fP The model utilizes a proprietary base of \fB116 thematic dictionaries\fP (over 21,000 words) loaded via Qt Resource System (QRC)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBMushup Strategy:\fP Combines parts of two words from two randomly selected thematic categories (e\&.g\&., \fRword1[start]\fP + \fRword2[end]\fP) to create a unique semantic core\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBSymbol Injection:\fP Random symbols and numbers are inserted and appended to the semantic core, adding an extra layer of randomness and ensuring high uniqueness across services\&.
.PP

.SS "Deployment (macOS Example)"
To create a standalone application bundle (\fR\&.app\fP), the project must be compiled in \fBRelease mode\fP and processed by the Qt deployment tool:
